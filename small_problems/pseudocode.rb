## PSEUDO CODE PRACTICE

# A method that returns the sum of two integers

# 1. Define method that takes two arguments
# 2. add the two arguments together
# end method

# A method that takes an array of strings and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# 1. Define a method that takes one array argument
# 2. Convert the array to string (to_s)
# 3. Remove all brackets from the created string
# 4. return the new concatenated string

# a method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array 
#         with every other element from the original array,starting with the first element.

# 1. define a new method that takes one array argument
# 2. create a counter equal to 1 
# 3. create an empty new array to hold the odd numbers
# 4. iterate through the array argument and if the counter is odd, add the array at index to new array
# 5. increaase counter by 1
# 6. return the new array with all the oddballs in it

#A method that returns the index of the third instance of a character in a string, nil if not that many instances

# 1. define a new method that takes two string arguments (the letter and the whole string)\
# 2. create counter == 0
# 3. transform the string to an array of characters
# 4. iterate through the array 
# 5. counter += 1 if array value == first method argument
# 6. when counter == 3, return index of that value
# 7. 

#  a method that takes two arrays, combines them together, and first array indexes are even, second array indexes are odd
# 1. define method that takes two array arguments
# 2. create twp new arrays equal to the first and second arrays
# 3. iterate through the duplicate first array and append the duplicate second array element at each index. Make sure that element is removed from the duplicate second array
# 4. return the new array
